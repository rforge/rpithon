Title: Use Python by Communicating Using a Pipe
Author: Jori Liesenborgs, Carlos J. Gil Bellosta
Maintainer: Jori Liesenborgs <jori.liesenborgs@uhasselt.be>
Description: rPithon is based on rPython (by Carlos J. Gil Bellosta), but instead of 
    linking to the Python libraries, a Python program is started and is 
    communicated with using a 'pipe'. This approach also allows multiple Python
    instances to be started, so that different R programs/packages can use 
    different Python instances if desired.
